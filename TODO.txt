* All remote libraries from one place, e.g. cdnjs
* Nicer slider?
* Make the nav bar "float" at the top.
* Fix the selected status for "no children" items.

---

Just as a rough plan of what needs to be done:
1. Fix the issues on safary(?) with transitions:
  * Remove the transition on hamburger icon middle line
  * The animation on top bar not working again
2. (next task) make the landing page with the carousel.
3. Put it all together to deploy on the Ã¡wiki.
4. Create a number of simple "themes" (html tags, basically) you guys can use to update individual pages from my template.

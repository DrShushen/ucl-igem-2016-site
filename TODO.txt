* All remote libraries from one place, e.g. cdnjs
* Nicer slider?
* Make the nav bar "float" at the top.
* Fix the selected status for "no children" items.

Just as a rough plan of what needs to be done:
1. (ongoing) browser / device optimisation, I think it's not well adapted for tablet screens yet.
2. (next task) make the landing page with the carousel.
3. Put it all together to deploy on the wiki.
4. Create a number of simple "themes" (html tags, basically) you guys can use to update individual pages from my template.

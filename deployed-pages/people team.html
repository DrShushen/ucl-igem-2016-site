                            <p>I am a 4th year Biochemistry (MSci) student obsessed with antibodies, ageing and
                                antibiotic resistance. Synthetic biology for me is a creative science and can be most
                                powerful when combined with other fields like architecture, art or computer science. In
                                iGEM I experiment in the lab and tell the world about it whether that is documenting our
                                progress on social media or giving talks to students and the public. Aside from this I
                                enjoy meeting and interacting with new people - whether that’s other iGEM teams or the
                                public. Thus I hope to be able to bring the two together through organising events to
                                engage everyone with synthetic biology! I am the early riser of the team and love waking
                                up to sunrises. When not iGEM-ing you will see me dancing (or trying to), exploring new
                                places and working as a student ambassador at UCL or shamelessly selling subscriptions
                                to The Economist.</p>

                        <p> I am an MRes Synthetic Biology student, so joining the UCL iGEM team made sense, do not worry, there is not much sense left in my life.  Among my uncountable passions are colourful socks, good spoons and maps.  iGEM is one of them too, as it is the best chance to show, beyond a bunch of proud freaks, what Synthetic Biology is about, and at the same time participate in an ambitious and responsible project. Our amazing project is about aging and wellbeing, or how to stop the first and extend the later. Aging is a fascinating topic for me since my younger years; I used to punch the wall of my bedroom as a kid because I did not tolerate death as an unavoidable thing.  Maybe my approach has changed but not the energy. As a kid and even today I would never give a glance to a map of the world that does not include Utopia. </p>

Science and Technology are part of my life passions, alongside arts, films, martial arts, learning languages and travelling (There are too many, I know). Also, I truly believe that synthetic biology is dramatically changing how people will live their lives, and this particular project is proof of that. By tackling the downwards of senescence at molecular level, this team is setting the pace for new thing to come in iGEM, just as biosensors did in the early competitions. I never heard about iGEM until my final year of undergrad, and by that time I couldn’t join my school’s team. Now, I am proud of being part of the UCL iGEM team as an advisor and help this team in this project and I have to say that this team are amazing. </p>

                        <h2>Healthy teeth: Healthy ageing: Xylitol</h2>
                        <p> After extensive research we identified xylitol, a sugar substitute that has been proven to defy tooth decay.
                            Our product is a tooth decay defying sweet made using xylitol. </p>
                        <p> An economic analysis of product showed that xylitol could be obtained in a much cheaper way – there is a real economic argument for producing this xylitol via a bioprocess as opposed to the expensive chemical process currently employed by industry.
                            Our market research shows there’s a huge opportunity for this. </p>
                        <p> We designed a gene circuit for insertion into E.coli that upon fermentation gives a higher percentage yield than current methods and saves an estimated X amount of energy. </p>
                        <p> We filed a patent for our design for xylitol production via fermentation. And here is a picture of our final prototype (sweet product). </p>

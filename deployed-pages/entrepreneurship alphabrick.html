                            <p>Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project
                                forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods)
                                can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial
                                difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such "nuggets" of computational work.</p>

                                We created this gene circuit using AlphaBrick. A software platform created by 2 of our Igem members as
                                part of the winning team in the UK’s first every synthetic biology biohackathon.  The platform makes synbio
                                more accessibly by simplifying the plasmid design process and integrating with transcriptic’s robotic labs
                                to automate the creation of the plasmid. We collaborated with 69 Igem teams, giving them free access to
                                the alpha version for use in their projects.

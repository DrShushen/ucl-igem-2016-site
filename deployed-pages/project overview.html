                            <h4> How do you envision yourself as an elderly member of society? Frail, with a stooped posture and with greater risk of some cancers? Or healthy, active and living a high quality of life? This year the UCL iGEM team are working to build new systems that increase the healthy human lifespan and solve some of the issues of the ageing population. We are achieving this by focusing on the root cause as opposed to traditional medicine which focuses on treating the symptoms of disease. </h4>
                            <br>

                            <h4> Ageing is a process that is caused by the cellular degeneration that leads to reduced maximum functional capacity of many organs, reduced capacity of cells to divide and increased risk of age-related diseases such as cancer. Simply put as cells age they become increasingly poor at functioning and repairing damage. Even though we are living longer than ever before, this does not equate to a higher quality of life in our older years. About 2/3 of the global population (100,000 per day) die as a result of age related causes. In industrialised nations, the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%. We believe that by targeting the causes of ageing, we are able in turn to cure the symptoms of ageing such as age related diseases like Alzheimer's and lung disease (COPD). </h4>

                            <h4> <i> We are living longer, and maintaining a high quality of life depends on healthy ageing. We all aspire to a long and healthy lives in old age, but we know that older people are at increased risk of disease and disability that can seriously affect quality of life for them and their families. </i> </h4>
                            <br>
                            <h4> Ageing is not necessarily a burden, and it doesn’t decrease a person’s ability to contribute to society. By showcasing some practical synthetic biology solutions to healthy ageing, interacting with the society, talking to politicians, religious leaders and policy makers we hope to that UCL iGEM can make healthy ageing a reality. </h4>

                            <h4> An ageing themed project has never been explored before on iGEM and we are really excited to build new systems that solve the issues of the ageing population as well as add to the registry and be one of the first to propose synthetic biology solutions to healthy ageing! </h4>

Biosynthage are working on therapies that prevent the onset of all these diseases. We have created a suite of solutions that are specific to organs that we feel are vital to human health and believe that targeting healthy ageing via many routes is the best way to maximise our ability to increase the healthy human lifespan. The health challenges currently posed by ageing are many and complex so we propose a suite of synthetic biology solutions to tackle these challenges seen below.

One of these important organs being the lungs. These changes contribute somewhat to an older person's reduced ability to do vigorous exercise, especially intense aerobic exercise. We propose a gene therapy that over expresses antioxidant Superoxide Dismutase 3 as a way to reduce oxidative damage that causes cells to age. </h4>

                            <h4>  <a href="http://2016.igem.org/Team:UCL/Gut"> <b> Gut: </b> </a> Increasing evidence suggests that oxidative damage to cells in the gut is one of the main causes of the ageing of gut cells. We are developing a bacterial oxidative stress sensitive probiotic that releases lycopene antioxidant in the presence of oxidative stress in the gut. </h4>
